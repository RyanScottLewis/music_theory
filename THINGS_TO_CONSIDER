There are different pitch notations:

There are different tunings:

There are different types of scales:

Questions I want to be able to answer with this gem:
  What are the chord names of these notes?
  What is the frequency of this note?
  What notes does the Cmaj13 chord consist of?
  What is the second inversion of the F7 chord?
  What is the scale degree of the F note on the C major scale?
  What scales does the G# note appear on and what scale degree?
  What are the all chord positions in the A minor scale and can I see as roman numeral notation?
  What are the scale degrees of a set of 4 chords in a specific scale?
  What about all scales which contain those chords?
  What is the closest inversion of chord A to chord B? (C maj to F major 1st inversion)
  What scales do A, B, and C# fit into?

I18n:
  The note name will depend on the notation and the parser will react according to the notation as well.
  Words like major, minor, min, maj, diminished, etc should have I18n

Symbols:
  ♭ flat
  ' octave of tonic
  + augmented
  ° diminished
  ø half diminished
  
We're using UTF for the symbols, so have an option to turn off UTF encoding
and return the symbol name instead. `MusicTheory.utf_preferred = false`.
Have a global option AND an option on a "Composition".

Look for a list of UTF music symbols.. time signatures would be nice =)
